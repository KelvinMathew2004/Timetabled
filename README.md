# Timetabled

## Overview
**Timetabled** is a grid-style calendar application designed to plan out a **single week** with one-hour events. In this project, you will create a personalized itinerary for someone, filling each day with specific activities. This can be for a real or imaginary person, historical figure, or even a pet. The goal is to visually represent a weekly schedule with varied events, colors, and additional information like descriptions and locations.
